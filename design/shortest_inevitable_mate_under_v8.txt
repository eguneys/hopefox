if mate_terminals are a filter of terminal_forced

do I also have to check forced_reachable property along the worlds parent child relationships, because I can already derive the move sequence given a world using the NodesManager as a separate entity where I track which moves are added to which nodes.

So this simple definition seems to cover it:
shortest_inevitable_mate(root) =
  min over w such that
    terminal_forced(root, w)
    AND is_checkmate(w)
