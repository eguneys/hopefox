your gate keeping logic for move generation is golden, basically I only allow possible tactical moves to expand and moves being applied to by spotting possibilities in existing positions. And have resolvers that do a backwards analysis starting from future positions to bring out tactics that have been played out. Of course branching logic and other details needs to be entailed but this seems expressive power.
