Basically I introduce 2 new concepts. First this align concept

align one bishop_sacrifice | skewer_queen_rook | setup_discovered_check


align "one" means all three facts are unified on the same .from .to move relationship and aliased to "one".

Second the syntactic sugar concept for this structure:

idea example_1
 alias one fact_1
 align two fact_a fact_b
 alias three fact_d
 line one two three


rewritten as in a simpler form ¿(without naming it)

binding
  fact_1
  fact_a fact_b
  fact_d


The only remaining unspecified feature being the check modifiers where a check can be given (un/capturable, un/blockable, un/evadable) modifiers.
