I am building a root-scoped relational forcing engine for chess tactics.

The engine does NOT do minimax or evaluation. Its purpose is to prove
inevitability using logical forcing:

  ∃ attacker commitment (root)
    such that
      ∀ forced continuations,
        all terminal forced worlds satisfy an invariant
        (e.g. checkmate, material gain).

Key concepts:

- forced_reachable(root, world):
  worlds that may occur under forced play from a root

- ExpandWorldsResolver:
  triggered by forced_reachable
  generates:
    worlds(root, parent, child)
    threatens(root, child, threat)
    forcing_attacker_move(root, parent, child) [explanatory]
    forced_reachable(root, child) (inline, for forcing attacker moves)
    expand_ready(root, parent)

- forced_defender_reply:
  triggered ONLY by expand_ready
  reads all worlds + threats for (root, parent)
  selects replies that resolve all dominant threats
  emits forced_reachable(root, reply)

- terminal_forced:
  a post-fixpoint judgement:
    defender_to_move AND no forced_defender_reply
    OR
    attacker_to_move AND no forcing_attacker_move


Currently the problem is, there is no way of knowing how to prune the forced_reachable paths. The computation explodes since we have to look at all opponent replies.
I almost gave up on this project because of this problem. But I think we can introduce some new concepts to make it work again.

A. You mentioned earlier there was a refuted(world) relation that prunes the lines so they don't expand. I will use that idea, and
B. Define some budget system, and a secondary heuristic system to limit and control how the search expands. which lines are preferred for exploration and things like that.



Budgets must never prune defender universality directly.
They may only prune attacker commitments.

You mentioned terminal_forced after making some changes, allows early success before full expansion, but as it currently is terminal_forced is a judgement calculated post-hoc. Do you think it should be calculated as a derivation so we can cut back early?
