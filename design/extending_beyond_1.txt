1. Instrument the misses before extending the language

Before adding more ideas, add diagnostics for skipped puzzles:

Which facts existed but no idea matched?

Which idea almost matched (failed constraints)?

Which required fact was never materialized?

Was depth insufficient, or was the idea absent?

This will tell you whether you need:

richer constraints

deeper lines

or entirely new idea families

Do not guess — measure.
