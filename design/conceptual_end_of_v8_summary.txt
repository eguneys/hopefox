You have built a proof engine, not a move engine.
Its power lies in inevitability, explanation, and refutation — not choice.



Verbatim:



I am building a root-scoped relational forcing engine for chess tactics.

The engine does NOT do minimax or evaluation. Its purpose is to prove
inevitability using logical forcing:

  ∃ attacker commitment (root)
    such that
      ∀ forced continuations,
        all terminal forced worlds satisfy an invariant
        (e.g. checkmate, material gain).

Key concepts:

- forced_reachable(root, world):
  worlds that may occur under forced play from a root

- ExpandWorldsResolver:
  triggered by forced_reachable
  generates:
    worlds(root, parent, child)
    threatens(root, child, threat)
    forcing_attacker_move(root, parent, child) [explanatory]
    forced_reachable(root, child) (inline, for forcing attacker moves)
    expand_ready(root, parent)

- forced_defender_reply:
  triggered ONLY by expand_ready
  reads all worlds + threats for (root, parent)
  selects replies that resolve all dominant threats
  emits forced_reachable(root, reply)

- terminal_forced:
  a post-fixpoint judgement:
    defender_to_move AND no forced_defender_reply
    OR
    attacker_to_move AND no forcing_attacker_move

Important properties:

- Attacker forcing moves are existential but NOT chosen or optimized
- Defender replies are universal (unless constrained by threats)
- Multiple forcing attacker moves coexist (e.g. Qe1# and Qxh4)
- Inevitability fails if ANY forced continuation avoids the invariant
- Shortest mates and example lines are extracted AFTER derivation,
  as graph queries, not during forcing

Current state:
- Architecture is stratified and stable
- Forced play terminates correctly
- I can prove or refute inevitability
- I can extract shortest mates or counterexamples post hoc

I want to continue discussing:
- what to build on top of this engine
- what kinds of questions it is best suited to answer
- how to extract explanations, classifications, or ideas
- how to extend invariants beyond mate (material, structure, etc.)
without breaking the forcing semantics.
