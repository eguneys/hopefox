let's map it 1-to-1 onto my current resolvers right now they look like this:

expand_worlds: reads forced_reachable
 emits: worlds threatens forcing_attacker_move expand_ready

forced_defender_reply: reads expand_ready
 emits: forced_defender_reply forced_reachable

forcing_attacker_move: reads expand_ready
 emits: forced_reachabl

let's remove reply id and make obligations world-based I guess. And I have a secondary concern about dependencies, these relations depend on each other, and might be reading stale data in this incremental system, isn't that an actual problem here?
