I think we need a new direction, let's mix the waters a little bit and speculate, I will start:

How about a symmetric-like relationship, instead of an attacker vs defender point of view, we have only one point of view which is turn_to_move, that works in turn flipping sides, and creating forced_reachable worlds. But as doing that, considering opponent point of view as well, so turn_to_move when expanding it's legal replies, considers some kind of context of the running idea on the board. This idea might be related to the on-going action happening in hypothetical worlds, whether a mating attack, or a material loss features, but in doing so if they fall into a trap like a mindless queen sacrifice, the next flipped point of view, will catch that, refute their attempt, neutralize and quiet the position and reach a terminal.
