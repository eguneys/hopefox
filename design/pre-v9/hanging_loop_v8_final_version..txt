First of all rows in a relation are deduped using computing a hash key for the entire row properties, so no worries there I hope.
Secondly, earlier we strictly agreed, the gateway how forced_reachable derives through an expand_ready signal it's recursive nature.

here's the current structure

ExpandWorldsResolver
 :depends on forced_reachable
 :emits worlds threatens forcing_attacker_move expand_ready


ForcedDefenderReply
 :depends on expand_ready
 :emits forced_defender_reply forced_reachable

Finally I added this symmetric to ForcedDefenderReply which allowed flow to pass through attacker moves, but also introduced the hang:

ForcingAttackerMove
 :depends on expand_ready
 :emits forced_reachable

The point is:
A. ForcingAttackerMove is the same as ForcedDefenderReply, except it doesn't emit forcing_attacker_move, which is handled by ExpandWorldsResolver already. Everything else flows the same.

If you think this structure is sound, we can issue how to break the hanging loop.
