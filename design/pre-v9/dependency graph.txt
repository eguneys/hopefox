Here's a dependency graph of relations

forced_reachable depends on:
  : worlds
  : forced_step

forced_step depends on:
  : worlds
  : only_reply

only_reply depends on:
  : forced_replies

forced_replies depends on:
  : worlds
  : in_check
  // future forcedness relations

in_check depends on:
  : worlds


So at what point do I intervene and say "now is the time to expand the worlds"
It seems like I can't find the correct point to make that call. Everything is intertwined like this.

But you see, only_reply depends on forced_replies, which depends on in_check of future worlds. So in order to create forced_replies, I need to apply legal moves, look at it's replies, and take those that are either in_check, or satisfies some other forcedness relation, (you said forcedness relations are growing system). 
That's why I look at in_check for future world using a relation and not statically through the hypotetical expansion of future world. So I can make use of the graph engine to derive future forcedness relations that I can query for deciding the forced_replies. I hope all that makes sense.


No here's what happens:

Iteration 0: 
 in_check(w0) is false. the check has not been played yet.
 forced_replies(w0), relies on in_check(w1) which it cannot find thus returns []
 only_reply(w0), is null because forced_replies(w0) was []

 w1 is never expanded, in_check(w1) is never calculated. forced_replies(w0) is []
