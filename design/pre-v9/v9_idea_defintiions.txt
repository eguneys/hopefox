I am on a tension between rigorously hard-coding tactical ideas, vs auto-generating unnamed ideas.
Earlier we had this statement:

These are bindings, not pattern matches
Each idea node explains why the move was necessary

Then we drifted into explaining why all legal moves must be included. In formal inevitable proof derivations.


I think I will generate some sort of an idea soup semi-automatically, then match those ideas against real positions to get a search tree and extract the solutions.

Let's go over a concrete example, I will describe the puzzle so that you can understand what it is spot on:

There is a queen vs queen alignment blocked by a rook.
Their queen is only defended by a knight. Our queen is undefended.
The rook captures knight, essentially sacrificing the exchange against a pawn.
But also discovering attack on the queen, and removing the defender of the queen.
And also defending our queen.
In this case, queen must deal with the attack, 
  Either it exchanges itself against our queen, rook recaptures and evades the attack it was under.
  Or it evades or protects the queen, rook evades the attack it was under.

This is the rigor I am dealing with, hard coding style preferred. This is at least a semi proof, or a variation of it I am sure. 
This is my goal.

Let's do another while we are at it:

Queen eyes a square that delivers mate in 1. King is in a mating net.
There is no safe way to defend that square, block the queens mate in 1 threat, or escape the mating net. Sacrificially liquidates queens by sacrificing the bishop with check followed by queen exchange on the same square.

No, I am not proving inevitibility, I've gone down that road, I found exhaustive legal reply space explosion.
