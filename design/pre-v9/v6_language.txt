Here's an initial draft of description language:

moves bishop
sacrifices to pawn
skewers queen and rook
sets up discovery for rook against king
captures pawn

pawn recaptures
pawn is loose (defended once attacked twice) # optional fact

rook recaptures with check
rook is defended by queen

queen recaptures
sacrifices to rook

queen recaptures
queen accepts sacrifice

# Overall gained material

It correctly and only describes the solution line for a tactical puzzle position. Ommitting the case for false negatives that may also match this, due to all the uncovered branching in an exhaustive fashion.


### Answer

8. A Clean Mental Model (Use This)

Think of your system as proving:

“Given structural constraints, the defender is out of resources.”

Your description language then answers:

“Here is one way the attacker cashes in.”

The inevitability proof answers:

“And here is why every defense fails.”

### vs Minimax

“This is adversarial reasoning over refutation lattices.”
