From earlier, the invariant requires answering:

Is there a queen belonging to the defender?
Is that queen under threat (direct or indirect)?
Can the defender avoid losing the queen?
If the queen is lost, is the maximum attacker loss ≤ rook?
Does this hold for all forced defender replies?


So our relations must support:

identifying pieces and their values
attacks and captures
forced replies
bounded material loss
inevitability across forced worlds
