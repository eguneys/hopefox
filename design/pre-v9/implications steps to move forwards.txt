## 
A proof-producing, relational, game-theoretic reasoning engine with explicit ∃/∀ structure

## Step 1 — Generalize invariants beyond mate
Next invariants:

material_gain ≥ X
wins_queen_for_rook
promotes_pawn
forces_draw

Key insight:
invariants operate on deltas, not absolute evaluation.


## Step 2 — Refine forcedness predicates

Right now forcedness is basically:

check
only reply

You can add:

threatened mate
hanging queen
unstoppable promotion

Each one reduces branching without harming soundness.

## Step 3 — Make invariants compositional

Example:

“deflection” → produces forced exposure
which enables → “fork”
which leads to → “material gain”

This is how unnamed ideas collapse into named ones.
You’re already structurally set up for this.

## Step 4 — Proof auditing & confidence levels

Because you have explicit invariants and witnesses, you can attach:

confidence
depth
robustness

This lets you say:
“This tactic is forced”
“This tactic relies on heuristic forcedness”
“This tactic is fragile”

That’s huge for training tools.


A domain-specific proof engine for adversarial reasoning

Progress will feel slow but deep

You are no longer searching for moves — you are proving inevitability.
