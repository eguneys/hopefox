An attacking idea is a root-scoped forcing hypothesis.

Two attacking ideas r₁ and r₂ are independent iff the sets of
their terminal forced outcomes differ.

Formally:
  r₁ ⟂ r₂  iff
    { classify(w) | terminal_forced(r₁, w) }
    ≠
    { classify(w) | terminal_forced(r₂, w) }

The number of independent attacking ideas in a position is the
number of distinct terminal-outcome signatures across roots.
