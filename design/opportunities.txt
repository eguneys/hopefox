I have a few dimensions of productive engineering opportunities:

Improve code editor intellisense extra IDE features debugging error messages autocomplete
Improve styling layout polish website in a user friendly way
Improve language design focus on anchors and how they can be encoded without obstrusive messiness
Focus on puzzle coverage and explore latent language feature extensions
Grind down existing low fruit puzzles to solidify and mature the language improve the confidence on it.

Definitely for the future optimizations, I haven't hit the unresponsive performance bottleneck yet.
