I have this kind of world set

root(R)
root_world(R, W)

world(W) :- root_world(_, W)
world(W) :- world_edge(_, _, W)

forced_reachable(R, W) :-
  root_world(R, W)

forced_reachable(R, C) :-
  world_edge(R, P, C)
  forced_reachable(R, P)

world_edge(R, P, C) :-
  expand_ready(R, P)
  $legal_world(P, C)

attacker_to_move(R, W) :-
  forced_reachable(R, W)
  $is_attacker(W)

defender_to_move(R, W) :-
  forced_reachable(R, W)
  $is_defender(W)



I need to parse this and build a relational graph incrementally expanding based on deltas. like a proof engine similar to Datalog or sorts.
It has to work on stratifications. So other strats will be build on top of these this is the first strat as is.

How would I go about parsing this and executing it in an engine.
