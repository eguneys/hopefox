I've decided on some format like this:

rook skewers queen and bishop
queen escapes skewer
rook captures bishop
queen recaptures
bishop pins queen to king
queen captures bishop
queen recaptures


and another this:

check with rook
queen blocks check
sacrifice rook with check to deflect king from defending queen
king deflects to hang the queen
queen captures hanging queen

So these rook queen bishop definitions are bindings of squares and occupancies of the accompanied roles. While skewers checks and pins define the attacking relationships and the actual moves being played. each line indicates a move with some property constraints. subsequent moves references either bindings or attacking relationships to expand the constraints even more on an ongoing position while being played out that specific line it mentions. 
And if a certain line is found that satisfies all constraints that's how you match a position with the existence of a tactic described by this language.
