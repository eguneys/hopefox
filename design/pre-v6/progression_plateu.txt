I hit a limit where I can't find a measure of progression. I tried encoding a single puzzle thema and extract all the puzzles that have matched, but for an arbitrary thema only 3 puzzles matched out of 1000. This hints me that puzzle themas are too broad and wide that resists fitting into categories. This makes grinding especially difficult, because I am just spending considerable brain power to nit pick specific puzzle themes out of a haystack. Either I have to find a ways to automate some work, or think of other ways to quantify the expressive power of the language to move onwards.
